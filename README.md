# NotionMail

*A simple mail app supported by Notion.*

## Overview
> Description of the program and additional improvements(s) you selected.

This is a simple CLI application that allows you to "send mail" to some specified user. The mail is stored inside a database within Notion.

I chose to also add timestamp support, which involved adding a *Date* property to the database I created.

    - This article was helpful in properly typing the database responses in my code. I used this author's method of Extraction to create types tailored to the `IMail` interface I created for the database.

## Future Improvements
> What are some future improvements you might make to this program or its code?

For future improvements, I might add some of the following features:

- Ability to delete emails
- Ability to flag or prioritize emails
- Ability to filter emails by message content
- Ability to send actual emails/messages to a physical user, rather than just storing them in a DB
